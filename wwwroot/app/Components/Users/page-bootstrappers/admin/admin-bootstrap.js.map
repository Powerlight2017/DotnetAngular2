The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n    most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n    For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n    can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n    The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n    discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n    Shimmed features:\n\n    * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n    element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n    reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n    document level stylesheet.\n    For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n      :host {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n      .foo {\n        background: red;\n      }\n\n    * encapsulation: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n    dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n    this feature.\n\n    By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n    as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n    of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n    div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n    x-foo div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n\n    Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n    selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n    simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n    in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n    Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n    For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n      div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n      div[x-foo] {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n    selector added to them manually.\n\n    * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n    shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n    inside a shadowRoot.\n\n    This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n    were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n    every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n    (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n    As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n    specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n    * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n    to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n    of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n    extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n    via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n      <style>\n        ::content(div) {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      </style>\n      <content></content>\n\n    could become:\n\n      <style>\n        / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n        ::content(div) {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      </style>\n      <div class=\"content-container\">\n        <content></content>\n      </div>\n\n    Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n    declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n    in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n  */\n  var ShadowCss = (function () {\n      function ShadowCss() {\n          this.strictStyling = true;\n      }\n      /**\n       * @param {?} cssText\n       * @param {?} selector\n       * @param {?=} hostSelector\n       * @return {?}\n       */\n      ShadowCss.prototype.shimCssText = function (cssText, selector, hostSelector) {\n          if (hostSelector === void 0) { hostSelector = '';

This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n      * controls\n      * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n      * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n      * as user input.\n      * *\n      * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n      * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n      * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n      * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n      * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n      * be avoided if possible.\n      * *\n      * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n      * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n      * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n      * *\n      * ### Syntax\n      * *\n      * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n      * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n      * *\n      * With `<template>` element:\n      * *\n      * ```\n      * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n      * <li>...</li>\n      * </template>\n      * ```\n      * *\n      * ### Example\n      * *\n      * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n      * example.\n      * *\n     */\n    var NgFor = (function () {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} _viewContainer\n         * @param {?} _template\n         * @param {?} _differs\n         * @param {?} _cdr\n         */\n        function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n            this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n            this._template = _template;\n            this._differs = _differs;\n            this._cdr = _cdr;\n            this._differ = null;\n        }\n        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n            /**\n             * @param {?} value\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            set: function (value) {\n                if (value) {\n                    this._template = value;\n                }\n            },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        /**\n         * @param {?} changes\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n                // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n                var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n                if (!this._differ && value) {\n                    try {\n                        this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                    }\n                    catch (e) {\n                        throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n      * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n      * *\n      * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n      * *\n      * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n      * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n      * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n      * *\n      * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n      * *\n      * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n      * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n      * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n      * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n      * *\n      * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n      * *\n     */\n    var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} _renderer\n         * @param {?} _elementRef\n         */\n        function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n            this._renderer = _renderer;\n            this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n            /** @internal */\n            this._optionMap = new Map();\n            /** @internal */\n            this._idCounter = 0;\n            this.onChange = function (_) { };\n            this.onTouched = function () { };\n        }\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n            this.value = value;\n            var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(this._getOptionId(value), value);\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n            var _this = this;\n            this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n                _this.value = valueString;\n                fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n            };\n        };\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

You can also\n      * listen to its {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n      * status is re-calculated.\n      * *\n      * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {@link FormArray} dynamically by\n      * calling its {@link FormArray.push} method.\n      * Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n      * *\n      * ### Example\n      * *\n      * {@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n      * *\n      * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n      * *\n      * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n      * *\n     */\n    var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$12(FormArrayName, _super);\n        /**\n         * @param {?} parent\n         * @param {?} validators\n         * @param {?} asyncValidators\n         */\n        function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._validators = validators;\n            this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n            this._checkParentType();\n            this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n            if (this.formDirective) {\n                this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n            }\n        };\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?

The arguments passed to this function are:\n * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n * projected inner Observable.\n * @method switchMap\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n}\nexports.switchMap = switchMap;\nvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n    }\n    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source._subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n    };\n    return SwitchMapOperator;\n}());\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n        this.index = 0;\n    }\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        var result;\n        var index = this.index++;\n        try {\n            result = this.project(value, index);\n        }\n        catch (error) {\n            this.destination.error(error);\n            return;\n        }\n        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (innerSubscription) {\n            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.closed) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n        this.remove(innerSub);\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n        if (this.isStopped) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n        if (this.resultSelector) {\n            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n        var result;\n        try {\n            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            this.destination.error(err);\n            return;\n        }\n        this.destination.next(result);\n    };\n    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/rxjs/operator/switchMap.js\n ** module id = 93\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\nvar Observable_1 = require('../../Observable');\nvar skipUntil_1 = require('../../operator/skipUntil');\nObservable_1.Observable.prototype.skipUntil = skipUntil_1.skipUntil;\n//# sourceMappingURL=skipUntil.js.map\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/rxjs/add/operator/skipUntil.js\n ** module id = 94\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

Optionally takes a {@link Scheduler} for\n * managing timers.\n *\n * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var result = clicks.debounceTime(1000);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link delay}\n * @see {@link sampleTime}\n * @see {@link throttleTime}\n *\n * @param {number} dueTime The timeout duration in milliseconds (or the time\n * unit determined internally by the optional `scheduler`) for the window of\n * time required to wait for emission silence before emitting the most recent\n * source value.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=async] The {@link Scheduler} to use for\n * managing the timers that handle the timeout for each value.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source\n * Observable by the specified `dueTime`, and may drop some values if they occur\n * too frequently.\n * @method debounceTime\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction debounceTime(dueTime, scheduler) {\n    if (scheduler === void 0) { scheduler = async_1.async; }\n    return this.lift(new DebounceTimeOperator(dueTime, scheduler));\n}\nexports.debounceTime = debounceTime;\nvar DebounceTimeOperator = (function () {\n    function DebounceTimeOperator(dueTime, scheduler) {\n        this.dueTime = dueTime;\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n    }\n    DebounceTimeOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source._subscribe(new DebounceTimeSubscriber(subscriber, this.dueTime, this.scheduler));\n    };\n    return DebounceTimeOperator;\n}());\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar DebounceTimeSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(DebounceTimeSubscriber, _super);\n    function DebounceTimeSubscriber(destination, dueTime, scheduler) {\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.dueTime = dueTime;\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.debouncedSubscription = null;\n        this.lastValue = null;\n        this.hasValue = false;\n    }\n    DebounceTimeSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        this.clearDebounce();\n        this.lastValue = value;\n        this.hasValue = true;\n        this.add(this.debouncedSubscription = this.scheduler.schedule(dispatchNext, this.dueTime, this));\n    };\n    DebounceTimeSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        this.debouncedNext();\n        this.destination.complete();\n    };\n    DebounceTimeSubscriber.prototype.debouncedNext = function () {\n        this.clearDebounce();\n        if (this.hasValue) {\n            this.destination.next(this.lastValue);\n            this.lastValue = null;\n            this.hasValue = false;\n        }\n    };\n    DebounceTimeSubscriber.prototype.clearDebounce = function () {\n        var debouncedSubscription = this.debouncedSubscription;\n        if (debouncedSubscription !== null) {\n            this.remove(debouncedSubscription);\n            debouncedSubscription.unsubscribe();\n            this.debouncedSubscription = null;\n        }\n    };\n    return DebounceTimeSubscriber;\n}(Subscriber_1.Subscriber));\nfunction dispatchNext(subscriber) {\n    subscriber.debouncedNext();\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=debounceTime.js.map\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/rxjs/operator/debounceTime.js\n ** module id = 104\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\nvar AsyncAction_1 = require('./AsyncAction');\nvar AsyncScheduler_1 = require('./AsyncScheduler');\nexports.async = new AsyncScheduler_1.AsyncScheduler(AsyncAction_1.AsyncAction);\n//# sourceMappingURL=async.js.map\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/rxjs/scheduler/async.js\n ** module id = 105\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
